# Global warming, home runs, and the future of America's pastime

Data and replication code for "Global warming, home runs, and the future of America's pastime," published in the _Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society_ by Christopher Callahan, Nate Dominy, Jerry DeSilva, and Justin Mankin. As of April 7 2023, the Early Online Release of the paper is available [here](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/aop/BAMS-D-22-0235.1/BAMS-D-22-0235.1.xml).

The repository is organized into **Scripts/**, **Figures/**, and **Data/** folders.

- **Scripts/**: All code required to reproduce the findings of our work is included in this folder. 

- **Figures/**: The final figures from the main text are included in this folder.

- **Data/**: This folder includes intermediate and processed summary data that enable replication of most the figures and numbers cited in the text. Some of the files for the climate model projections are quite large, so they are not provided here. Should you desire any of this underlying data, feel free to contact me at _Christopher.W.Callahan.GR (at) dartmouth (dot) edu_ and I will be happy to organize a mass data transfer.


Finally, this repository includes game log and event file data from [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org/) as well as data on individual batted balls from [Statcast](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs). Please credit these organizations if you use any of this data for any reason.
